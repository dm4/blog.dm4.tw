> AirPlay also utilizes the authentication IC to verify that receivers have been approved by Apple. AirPlay audio and video streams utilize the MFi-SAP (Secure Association Protocol), which encrypts communication between the accessory and device using ECDH key exchange (Curve25519) with 2048-bit RSA keys and AES-128 in CTR mode.
